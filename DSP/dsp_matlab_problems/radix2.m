% Observation
% An error (difference between MATLAB fft and radix-2 increases with the increase of size of the analyzed signal)

% Conclusion #1 (NOT SURE)
% I think with the increase of vector size (2^p) number of 
% calculation operations performed in myRecFFT function also increases.  
% That's why error increases as the matrix is splitted and joined more and more times

% Conclusion #2 (From prof. book) 
% In this radix-2 method we perform (N/2) * log_2_(N) multiplications

% Conclusion #3 (joining two previous Conclusions)
% Observe that figure 1 has logarythmic shape :) 
% That's what prof proved in conclusion 2 !

% Final conclusion: As the number of operation performed increases logarythmic 
% the error also reminds exponential curve 

% BONUS! time comparison between MATLAB fft and radix-2

% Observation
% Time comparison between radix-2 and MATLAB. For large matrices (p>12)
% The differeence between radix-2 and MATLAB increases. 
% radix-2 is much slower for these values
